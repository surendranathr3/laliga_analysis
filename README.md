Analysis of laliga match stats between 2009 and 2019

This is an analysis of match stats of all laliga teams with a focus on Barca and Real Madrid
Here are a few aspects I want to investigate with this 10 years dataset:
1. Comparison of barca vs real madrid home and away records
2. Percentage distribution of each team's wins,draws and losses
3. Comparison of atletico's stats to barca and real madrid
